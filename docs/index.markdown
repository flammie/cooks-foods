# Flammie cooks foods

This website contains *recipes* made by [Flammie](../). It's based on a recipe
website management software I have written. It aims to be low tech no nonsense
tool I wrote up on a lunch break, for recipes that I will mostly use myself but
can be useful for others. There's no ads here and there won't be 5 page essays
attached to the recipes, just the instructions on how to make foods. I am not
particularly good chef but a foodie and I know how I can make food that I like.
I don't use recipes that much but these do serve as a scratch pad of what I've
tried so far and what worked. Maybe someone else can find it useful too.
